# Simple p2p network 

This is a simple p2p network that uses a blockchain to store data. It is a simple implementation of a blockchain and is not intended to be used in production.
I use this project to learn about blockchain and p2p networks.

## Consensus
In this project, I use snowball consensus algorithm to reach consensus. Snowball is a consensus algorithm that is used in the avalanche protocol. It is a probabilistic consensus algorithm that is used to reach consensus in a p2p network. It is a simple algorithm that is easy to implement and understand. It is also a good algorithm to use to learn about consensus algorithms.

## How to run
